# Reliable Shellcode

## Utilising ROP

The problem with shellcode exploits as they are is that the locations of it are questionable - wouldn't it be cool if we could control where we wrote it to?

Well, we can.

Instead of writing shellcode directly, we can instead use some ROP to take in input again - except this time, we specify the location as somewhere we control.

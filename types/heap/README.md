# Heap

Still learning :\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
I will be using a Xenial Xerus VM to do all of these challenges. This is due to the lack of protections on glibc 2.23, and also because radare2 doesn't support heap on the glibc version my Parrot VM works on.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
I may use screenshots more with the heap-related stuff within radare2, as the colour scheme really helps when working out what's happening.
{% endhint %}
